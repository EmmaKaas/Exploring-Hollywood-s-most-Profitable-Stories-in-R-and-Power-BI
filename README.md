# Exploring Hollywood's most Profitable Stories in R and Power BI

As part of the JustIT data bootcamp we have been assigned some projects to demonstrate our understanding of the applications and our abilities in exploring datasets using these applications.

For this assignment we were given the task of exploring the dataset 'Hollywoods Most Profitable Stories' (which is available from Tableau's sample datasets) in R Studio and Power Bi. First eaploring and cleaning the data in R Studio and then creating a visualisation in Power Bi in line with a brief given by a client. 

This was a great exercise in using R Studio and becoming more familier with the software and using it for data cleaning and charts. Then using Power Bi and working to a brief making the visualisation in accordance to with the wishes of the client, in addition to imporving my presentation skills, making is visually appealing and easy to navigate.

Feel free to have a look over the attached project detailing my process for more information!
